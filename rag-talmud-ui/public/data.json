Also mood changes, dizziness, tiredness, and interference with overall mental well-being are reported[<a href=\"https://chatnoir-webcontent.chatnoir.eu/?index=msmarco-v2.1-segmented&trec-id=msmarco_v2.1_doc_12_541815956%2314_978601115\">4</a>, <a href=\"https://chatnoir-webcontent.chatnoir.eu/?index=msmarco-v2.1-segmented&trec-id=msmarco_v2.1_doc_12_541815956%2315_978603660\">5</a>, <a href=\"https://chatnoir-webcontent.chatnoir.eu/?index=msmarco-v2.1-segmented&trec-id=msmarco_v2.1_doc_51_318853832%235_734634698\">6</a>].

      "comment": "This is a fairly thoughtful response. Strengths: the student acknowledges both reported experiences (mood changes, creativity, dreams, agitation) and the role of personal beliefs. Importantly, they highlight that astrology has no scientific backing and recommend relying on reputable sources, showing critical thinking. Weaknesses: the answer is repetitive, not very concise, and mixes subjective claims with vague symptoms without clear distinction between evidence-based and belief-based effects. It would be stronger if it emphasized scientific findings more directly and structured the points more clearly.",

      "comment": "I see where the first review was coming from, but it’s a bit too strict and undersells the student’s effort. The student did several things very well: They showed awareness of both cultural/astrological perspectives and scientific caution. They balanced possible effects (creativity, agitation, mood changes) with the disclaimer that astrology isn’t evidence-based. They ended with a sensible suggestion to consult reputable health sources. Yes, the response could be clearer and less repetitive, but for a student, this is a strong effort that shows critical thinking, awareness of different viewpoints, and some sensitivity to mental health. Those are important qualities.",

      "comment": "The student’s answer does cover a range of possible effects and importantly mentions the lack of scientific support for astrology, which is good. However, as the first assessment pointed out, the explanation is repetitive and blends belief-based claims with actual mental health impacts without making a clear enough distinction. The structure is also loose, jumping between symptoms, astrology, and advice, which makes it harder to follow. While the critical note at the end is helpful, the bulk of the response leans too much on unverified claims rather than evidence.",
